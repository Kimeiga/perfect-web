"""Mutation controls for ADR-0290: a verification run is dealt by the
seconds its recipes last took.

Each mutant undoes one piece: the plan's costs read from the seconds kept,
a shard's setup counted where a recipe is dealt, the unmeasured estimated
at the upper quartile of its kind (the amendment of 2026-10-09: not the
median, not every recipe's, its scripts read for its kind, the host's
tests a kind of their own), the database recipes' shards chosen by when
the run ends (and the fewest of those that end it as soon), and the fetch
keeping only a recipe that ran to its end, over the others kept; and (the
amendment of 2026-10-10) a run dealt into more shards than it asks for where
its own would end a shard past the ceiling, a recipe longer than it alone
let be, and the ceiling under a shard's limit; and (ADR-0281's amendment
of 2026-10-12) the fetch refusing a file whose recipe reads what changed
since its run, against the tree here, staged or not, and one no recipe
wrote, and copying none of a recipe it skips; and (its amendment of
2026-10-13) a push to `master` planned from the newest commit on its
first-parent line that a push's or the nightly's run passed at, read by its
commit, and from the commit before the push on any error; and (its
amendment (6)) a push running no recipe whose committed evidence is
current: evidence not current where what the recipe reads changed since,
where it was written from a tree with changes, where the head does not
descend from its commit, or where the recipe's files were recorded at two
commits or one not at all; the plan dropping what is current only where it
is asked, and the workflow asking at each push; and (train-5's finding,
2026-10-14) a recipe planned by a program its own lines name, a glob read
segment by segment and a path naming what is under it. At least one test of
`scripts/tests/test_ci_scripts.py` must then fail.

Run from the repository root; `just e14-dealt-by-time` records the output.
The sources are restored after every mutant, whatever happens.
