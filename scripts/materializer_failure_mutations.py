"""Mutation controls for ADR-0176: a regeneration that fails sends nothing,
and is tried again.

Each mutant undoes one piece:
- the drain: a failed regeneration's frames sent at the version that did
  not move; a stale entry not tried again; a regeneration tried again that
  sends nothing;
- the answer: the commit names the version that did not move;
- the subscription: a page's request does not drain its session;
- the control: `/bench/materializer` arms nothing.

A drain, answer or control mutant must fail the development server's tests,
all of them run; the subscription's, `e2e/materializer.spec.mjs` in
Chromium.

Run from the repository root; `just e14-materializer-failure` records the
output. The source is restored after every mutant, whatever happens.
