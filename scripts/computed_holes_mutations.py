"""Mutation controls for ADR-0226: a value the template computes compiles.

Each mutant undoes one piece: what a computed hole and a computed attribute
read; each refusal of what a host does not compute; the function run as the
last step, and the attribute set again; the component found by its name; the
host running it and rendering with it; the checker's rule that it performs
nothing, and what that rule leaves to others; and what A-032's first drafts
found, the qualified call check and a character between tags that the lexer
has no rule for. The tests of each must then fail.

The browser suite's `e2e/feed.spec.mjs` shows the thread's counts with
scripts off, and a like's reaching the open thread, in three engines.

Run from the repository root; `just e14-computed-holes` records the output.
The source is restored after every mutant, whatever happens.
