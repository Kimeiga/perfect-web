"""Mutation controls for ADR-0151: a page's values are read outside the
subscriber table.

Each mutant undoes one piece:
- a document read inside the table again, so pages read at once wait for
  each other and never share a query's flight;
- a document installed although a change reached its session while it was
  read, or a frame pushed to a session not counted;
- the cart's count read from every binding, so a command asks every query
  its page reads.

A mutant must fail the server's tests, all of them run: ADR-0148's controls
found tests a name filter left out.

Run from the repository root; `just e14-document-reads` records the output.
The source is restored after every mutant, whatever happens.
