"""Mutation controls for ADR-0104 and ADR-0208: the dev server commits the
events a command computes, and no others.

Each mutant undoes one piece: committing the events the command handed the
outbox rather than `CartChanged` whatever it computed, keeping what it
handed, and each value's text as a key. The dev server's tests must then
fail.

Run from the repository root; `just e10-committed-events` records the
output. The source is restored after every mutant, whatever happens.
