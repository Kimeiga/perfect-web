"""Mutation controls for track store-pg: the store's data behind the
DataLayer seam, in memory and on PostgreSQL.

Each mutant undoes one piece:
- an order placed without its lines, in either layer, or on PostgreSQL;
- a commit without its events, its outbox's rows not written;
- a command's transaction left at the connection's default, and the
  isolation answered rather than measured;
- a commit the database refused answered as committed;
- the outbox not read back, and the commit not recorded in the materializer,
  or recorded without its rows;
- the store's connections searching more than its own schema;
- a program let name one of the host's own operations;
- a delivered event left in the materializer's outbox.

The tests then fail: the store's PostgreSQL tests, and the store's tests
of an order, its events and its host operations, run in memory and with
the store on PostgreSQL (PW_STORE_TEST_LAYER=postgres).

They need a database: `PW_STORE_DATABASE_URL`, a throwaway one, which each
test uses in a schema of its own. Without it every PostgreSQL test passes
doing nothing, and no mutant could be killed, so this refuses to run.

Run from the repository root; `just e14-store-postgres` records the output.
The source is restored after every mutant, whatever happens.
