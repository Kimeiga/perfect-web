"""Mutation controls for ADR-XXXX: a page's commands run in the order it sent
them.

Each mutant undoes one piece:
- the server's: a command run without waiting for the one it names; one run
  whose named one never came, or was answered early, or is still running;
  the wait not waited, or never ended; a command closed unrun, or answered
  early, taken for one that ran; another session's command taken for the
  one named; one in flight let go past the bound; a session forgotten that
  keeps its commands' order; an early answer that is no refusal;
- the runtime's: a command that names none before it, or the first and not
  the latest; an early answer taken for a failure; one sent again at once,
  or naming the one before it again; a command kept unanswered after its
  answer; one whose answer never settles what waits for it.

The server's must fail its tests (`order::`, and the command route's over
HTTP); the runtime's, `e2e/command-order.spec.mjs` in Chromium. Run from the
repository root; `just e14-command-order` records the output. The source is
restored after every mutant, whatever happens.
