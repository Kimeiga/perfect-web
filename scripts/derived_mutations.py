"""Mutation controls for ADR-0082: a `derived` value performs no effect.

Each mutant undoes one piece of how a `derived` value is held pure: that it
is checked at all, that only what the value itself performs counts, and that
what it names and reads counts as well as what it calls. The derived-purity
tests must then fail.

Run from the repository root; `just e10-derived` records the output.
The source is restored after every mutant, whatever happens.
