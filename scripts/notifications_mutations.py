"""Mutation controls for track `notifications` (ADR-0270, ADR-0274).

Each mutant undoes one piece: the listener rule as ADR-0270 amends ADR-0091
(a handle binds an event's id, in a listener alone, for `User` alone, over
the event's own type); the host answering the reader's user; a like, a reply
or a follow writing a notification, and one's own act writing none; a
deleted post taking its notifications; a user reading their own alone, kept
in their session's partition and in no cache every reader shares; an event
naming a user dropping that user's entries and no other's; and reading them
reaching each of the reader's sessions. The tests in
`compiler/pw-core/tests/principal.rs` or
`spikes/own-renderer/server/src/tests/notifications.rs` must then fail.

The PostgreSQL mutants run where `PW_FEED_DATABASE_URL` names a database,
and are reported as not run otherwise.

Run from the repository root; `just e14-notifications` records the output.
The source is restored after every mutant, whatever happens.
