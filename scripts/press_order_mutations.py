"""Mutation control for ADR-0152's correction: presses run in the order they
were made.

A handler's code loads on its first press, so a second press's code can
arrive first. The mutant lets a handler start without waiting for the press
before it. The browser test that delays the first press's code must then
fail, in Chromium.

Run from the repository root; `just e14-keyed-reads` records the output.
The source is restored after the mutant, whatever happens.
