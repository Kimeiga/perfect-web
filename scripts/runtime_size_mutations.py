"""Negative controls for ADR-0188: a page's runtime is bounded as it is sent.

Each control grows what a page downloads by bytes that do not compress:
- the runtime's script, by a comment of 48 KB of random text, which gate
  item 7b must refuse;
- the renderer's WebAssembly, by 64 KB of random bytes it exports, which gate
  item 7d must refuse.

A bound that a grown file passes bounds nothing. Every control must fail
`e2e/runtime-size.spec.mjs`, against a build of the grown source.

Run from the repository root; `just e14-runtime-size` records the output.
The source is restored after every control, whatever happens, and the build
is made again from it.
