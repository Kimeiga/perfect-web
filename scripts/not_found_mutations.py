"""Mutation controls for ADR-0163: a page says when it is absent.

Each mutant undoes one piece:
- the checker (PW0342): the clause held to pages, its value read as
  `Type.Case` of a type, the case the type's, and a query the page reads
  answering it with a failure of that type;
- the plan: the case carried by its WIT name, on the bindings whose query
  can answer it, and written where a host reads it;
- the parser: the clause a policy it knows;
- the development server: a binding's declared case told from any other
  failure, carried up as its own kind, and answered 404, with its reason;
- the not-found page: a heading a reader can find.

A checker, plan or parser mutant must fail `compiler/pw-core/tests/
not_found.rs`; a server mutant, and the plan's written field, the server's
tests, all of them run; the not-found page's, `e2e/stores.spec.mjs` in
Chromium.

Run from the repository root; `just e14-not-found` records the output. The
source is restored after every mutant, whatever happens.
