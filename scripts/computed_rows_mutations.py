"""Mutation controls for ADR-0228: a value computed in a row is the row's.

Each mutant undoes one piece: the path a row's value is named by, from the
innermost loop's item; the host's row read, its function and its path; the
speculation module's value for each row and for a part, and what it refuses;
and what the feed's rows and likes found: a field of a value charged a
same-named function's effects, and an opaque value that did not compare. The
feed's like shown before the server answers must fail too.

The compiler's and the server's tests must fail for a mutant of the compiler
("cargo"). A mutant of the feed must fail `e2e/feed.spec.mjs` in three
engines, against a build of the mutated source ("browser").

Run from the repository root; `just e14-computed-rows` records the output.
The source is restored after every mutant, whatever happens.
