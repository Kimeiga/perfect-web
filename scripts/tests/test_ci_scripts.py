"""The verification run's scripts (ADR-0245), each on what it decides.

- `ci_plan.py` deals recipes into shards, the longest first, each where it
  ends soonest, its setup counted, by the seconds each last took, the same
  way every time; leaves out the measurements of a machine; gives the
  recipes run against a database shards and a PostgreSQL of their own, as
  many as end the run soonest; takes more shards than it is asked for where
  its number would end a shard past the ceiling under a shard's limit;
  reaches from a change to the mutation scripts it touches; and, as a push
  plans, runs no recipe whose committed evidence is current;
- `ci_recipes.py` takes what a recipe wrote to be the files whose bytes
  changed while it ran, and frees what its builds leave;
- `ci_summary.py` fails a run where a recipe failed, a mutant survived, or a
  shard reported nothing;
- `evidence_fetch.py` names the run after a file's `commit:` line, and
  refuses a file of another commit, a file whose recipe reads what changed
  since the run, against the tree here, and a run that failed anywhere but
  in the jobs it is told are known; and keeps the seconds of each recipe
  that ran to its end;
- `verified_base.py` plans a push to `master` from the newest commit on its
  first-parent line that a push's or the nightly's verify run passed at,
  and from the commit before the push where none did, or on any error.
