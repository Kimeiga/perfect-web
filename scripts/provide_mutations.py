"""Mutation controls for ADR-0144: a view's own signals, and a signal a page
provides to the views it composes.

Each mutant undoes one part:
- a module's `signal`, a `provide`, and what may assign the signal;
- each use of a view holding its own instance, the instance a provided
  signal is where a view is used, and the element saying which instance a
  handler's signal is;
- the blocks that own an instance, and the first values the plan holds;
- the rules: a provider for each need (PW5305), one `provide` (PW5306), no
  view holding a signal in a loop's row (PW5307), and a module signal read
  and changed where a page's is;
- the browser reading and setting each handler's instance, and starting a
  block's instances again when it shows another arm;
- the Marko adapter refusing what it does not model, rather than dropping it.

A compiler mutant must fail `labels.rs`'s neighbour, `provide.rs`. A browser
mutant must fail `e2e/provide.spec.mjs`, in Chromium, against the staged
build: run `BUILD_ONLY=1 bash spikes/own-renderer/run.sh` first.

Run from the repository root; `just e14-provide` records the output. The
source is restored after every mutant, whatever happens.
