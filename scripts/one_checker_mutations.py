"""Mutation controls for ADR-0090: `pw build` checks what `pw check` checks.

Each mutant undoes one piece: running the declaration rules inside the one
checker, and holding their diagnostics to the checker's standard (the
registry's sentence for an invariant, a boundary span, an explanation, the
policy as written). The tests in `one_checker.rs` and `checking_source.rs`
must then fail.

Run from the repository root; `just e10-one-checker` records the output.
The source is restored after every mutant, whatever happens.
