"""Mutation controls for ADR-XXXX: a control is shown where its command's
predicates hold.

Each mutant undoes one piece:
- the checker: a name that holds no value read as one (PW0629), a predicate
  with parameters asked, a handler asking one; a control shown wherever, an
  `{#if}` or a `hidden` asserting nothing, an `{:else}` keeping what its
  condition asserted, a disjunction asserting its sides, a `|refusable`
  control held to the rule (PW5048); a page served to everyone asking its
  reader (PW5049); a predicate's answer no `Bool`;
- the lowering and the plan: a predicate read by no name of its own, an
  attribute computed from an answer reading nothing, a hole or a computed
  value reading an answer refused, the plan naming no predicate; a region a
  speculation renders again not holding the answers;
- the host: no answer given, an answer always true, the document not
  carrying the answer;
- the browser runtime: a region rendered again without the answers.

A checker, lowering or plan mutant must fail
`compiler/pw-core/tests/controls_where_they_hold.rs`; a host or speculation
mutant, the host's test of a control shown where its predicate holds; the
runtime's, the feed's speculated post in Chromium.

Run from the repository root; `just e14-holds` records the output. The source
is restored after every mutant, whatever happens.
