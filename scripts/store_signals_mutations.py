"""Mutation controls for ADR-0140: a page that reads queries holds signals
too.

Each mutant undoes one half: the store's page rendered at its signals' first
values, and its document carrying them. The server's tests must then fail.

Run from the repository root; `just e14-store-signals` records the output.
The source is restored after every mutant, whatever happens.
