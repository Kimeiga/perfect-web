"""Mutation controls for ADR-0184: what a cache may keep holds nothing of a
session's (charter §15.6 tests 2 and 13).

Each mutant undoes one piece:
- the wire: a session's response, whole or streamed, kept by any cache; a
  file of the build naming a session;
- the server's shared caches: a private query's value kept for every
  reader; a session's cart materialized in the public partition.

A server mutant must fail the development server's tests; a browser
mutant, `e2e/shared-output.spec.mjs` in Chromium, against a build of the
mutated source.

Run from the repository root; `just e14-shared-output` records the output.
The source is restored after every mutant, whatever happens.
