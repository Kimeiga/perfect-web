"""Mutation controls for track store-accounts: a cart and an order a user's,
a guest's cart joining its user's at sign-in, and a record's scope the
scopes of the queries that produce it, joined (ADR-XXXX).

Each mutant undoes one piece:
- a user's cart read and written by the session, not the reader's handle;
- a user's order read for another owner than the reader;
- the store keying a session's cart and order by the session where the
  program reads them by the reader (`Server::owner`);
- a session's cart entry keyed by the session, so the user's event reaches
  it nowhere;
- the guest's lines joined without summing one item's quantities;
- the guest's cart left as it was after joining;
- a sum past a bigint wrapped rather than refused;
- a signed-in session that signs in again joined to the next user;
- the deployment not told of a guest's sign-in;
- on PostgreSQL, a cart read whoever owns it;
- in the compiler, `private` giving a record no scope, and disagreeing
  producers keeping the last one's scope alone;
- `user` not a visibility (the parse refuses `user query`), not lowered as
  the declaration's visibility, and not importable;
- telling by principal undone: the key's user not read, so every reader of
  the query is told, or the user's other sessions not told;
- milestone 2, delivery addresses: a store's radius read in kilometres; the
  estimate without the courier's travel, or answering a store out of
  reach; an Add or an order to a store out of reach let through; a saved
  address not chosen, or a choice leaving the last one chosen; an eleventh
  address kept; a place the table does not hold saved; on PostgreSQL, a
  reader's addresses read whoever saved them, or store 48 delivering as far
  as store 47; and the store's reach not told when the reader's addresses
  change;
- milestone 1's rest, the stale tab (Q3): the host reading no document a
  command names; a page shown to another session, or one the host no
  longer holds, answered; a request from no numbered page refused; the
  predicate's words told for the platform's; and the runtime naming no
  document.

Each mutant names its suite, and runs that suite's tests alone (W6's ruling
of 2026-10-09, as `refusal_mutations.py` does): `server`, the store's
accounts tests (tests/store_accounts.rs), its addresses tests
(tests/addresses.rs), the places' unit tests and the join's, in memory and
with the store on PostgreSQL (PW_STORE_TEST_LAYER=postgres), and identity's
sign-in tests; `core`, the compiler's boundary and visibility tests
(boundary_matrix.rs, boundary.rs's own, user_visibility.rs); `browser`, the
stale tab in Chromium (e2e/store-accounts.spec.mjs), after the store's page
and the servers are built.

They need a database: `PW_STORE_DATABASE_URL`, a throwaway one, which each
test uses in a schema of its own (and `PW_FEED_DATABASE_URL`, the feed's,
for the notifications' test on PostgreSQL; the recipe names one for both). Without it every PostgreSQL run would read
the in-memory layer and no PostgreSQL mutant could mean anything, so this
refuses to run.

Run from the repository root; `just e14-store-accounts` records the output.
The source is restored after every mutant, whatever happens.
