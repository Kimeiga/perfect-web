"""Mutation controls for ADR-0190: every page that binds a query is served at
its route, and kept current by its own plan.

Each mutant undoes one piece of the development server's:
- a page that binds a query served as a page of signals, which refuses it;
- every document recorded as the store's;
- a document's bindings read by the store's plan;
- a document patched against the store's template;
- a change sent to the store's documents alone;
- the store's menu fragment rendered for every page;
- the store's menu told to every document of its store.

Every mutant must fail the development server's tests of a second page.

Run from the repository root; `just e14-pages` records the output. The
source is restored after every mutant, whatever happens.
