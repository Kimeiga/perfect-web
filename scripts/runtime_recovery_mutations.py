"""Mutation controls for ADR-0155: the page keeps its subscription, and
recovers a refused handler.

Each mutant undoes one piece of the browser runtime:
- a failed subscription request ends the subscription, as it did;
- a press on a refused handler does nothing, as it did;
- the recovery codes are read one place off, as they were.

The browser tests that drop a connection and press a stale handler must
then fail, in Chromium.

Run from the repository root; `just e14-runtime-recovery` records the
output. The source is restored after every mutant, whatever happens.
