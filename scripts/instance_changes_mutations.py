"""Mutation controls for ADR-0168: a change reaches every part that reads
it.

Each mutant undoes one piece:
- the renderer: a changed attribute, or a changed text, not set; a block
  that changed set in place; an attribute's value not the one the document
  writes;
- the development server: a rename that sets the name's text alone; the menu
  control decoding only `%20`;
- the browser runtime: an attribute patch not applied, or applied as
  written rather than as parsed; an instance already in place moved.

A renderer mutant must fail `pw-render`'s tests, all of them run; a server
mutant, the server's tests or the browser's; a runtime mutant,
`e2e/stores.spec.mjs` or `e2e/keyed-list.spec.mjs` in Chromium.

Run from the repository root; `just e14-instance-changes` records the
output. The source is restored after every mutant, whatever happens.
