"""**What made a mutation script's baseline red** (2026-10-08).

A script whose unmutated baseline fails says so and stops: "no mutant can
mean anything". Until this it said no more, and a red baseline on CI or here
named neither the test that failed nor the build error: on 2026-10-08
`invariants_mutations.py` said "586 passed, 2 failed", and finding the two,
two committed components gone stale, took the suite run again by hand.

A script imports this module first in its `main()`. From then on what each
command it runs says is kept as the command ends, with how it ended: the
last `KEPT` commands, the end of what each said. Where the script reports a
red baseline, `explain()` prints what failed in what its commands said: each
failing test and the first line of its panic, a build's first errors, or,
from a browser suite, each failing test and its error. Nothing is run again:
a failure that comes and goes is named as it came, and the commands are the
script's own, however it holds them, in their own directories and
environments.

It keeps what `subprocess.Popen.communicate` returns, which
`subprocess.run` calls. A script imports it in `main()`, not at its top, so
that loading a script to read its mutants (`ci_plan.py`,
`mutation_anchors.py`) needs nothing beside it.

Imported, it first makes the script run its sources as they are (track
evidence-integrity, finding 1). Python takes a cached `.pyc` for its source
where the two agree in the source's size and its modification time in whole
seconds, so a mutant of a Python source the same size as its anchor,
restored within the second it was written in, left its bytecode to stand
for the restored source in the next run: another mutant's, a baseline's, or
`just ci`'s. From the import on, neither the script nor any process it
starts writes bytecode, and the bytecode cached for each Python source its
`MUTANTS` change is removed: writing none stops no reading, and bytecode
left by an earlier run would still be read.

Imported, it also bounds in memory every process the script starts from
then on (`mutation_bound.py`, 2026-10-09): a mutant's test that holds more
than the bound is stopped, the script's output says so, and its last line
says what the bound did, a kind of kill apart from a test's.

And first, where `PW_MUTANT_SLOTS` asks for more than one slot, it hands
the run to `mutation_slots.py`, which runs the script's own copy in each
slot, its mutants dealt among them, and ends this process with the run's
code: the script's loop never runs in this tree.

And where the run sets `PW_MUTANT_INCREMENTAL=1` (verify.yml's recipe step),
the script and every process it starts have no `CARGO_INCREMENTAL`, whatever
its recipe's line says, so that cargo's defaults apply (incremental for the dev
and test profiles), and the incremental caches are removed when they hold more
than a bound (`mutant_incremental.py`, 2026-10-20).
