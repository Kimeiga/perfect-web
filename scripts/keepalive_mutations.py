"""Mutation controls for ADR-0268: a command outlives the page that sent it.

Each mutant undoes one piece of the browser runtime's `command`: the request
not kept alive; the budget not read; the bytes in flight not counted, or not
uncounted when a request is answered or fails; a body counted in characters
rather than bytes; and `?keepalive=` raising the budget past the Fetch
standard's 64 KiB, or an unreadable one keeping it whole. Each must fail
`e2e/keepalive.spec.mjs`, or the feed's post counted by its bytes, in
Chromium.

Run from the repository root; `just e14-keepalive` records the output. The
source is restored after every mutant, whatever happens.
