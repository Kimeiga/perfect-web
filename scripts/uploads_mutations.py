"""Mutation controls for the uploads track (ADR-0260): an image on a post.

Each mutant undoes one piece, and the tests must then fail:

- what a file is, sniffed from its bytes: the kind taken from the sender, a
  served image typed by its path's extension, a PNG's CRC unread;
- its limits: the size raised before the body is read, and after; its width
  and height unchecked; a JPEG's Exif turn ignored; a deployment raising a
  program's limit;
- where it is kept and served: a key that is not 64 hex digits taken, so a
  path is built from what a sender wrote; `nosniff`, the sandbox or the
  immutable cache dropped; a lease served to another session, or served
  where committed images are before its post commits;
- who: one signed out attaching an image; a user's hourly count, or bytes,
  not held;
- its life: an upload from another origin taken; a claim a command did not
  commit not given back; a discarded lease kept; a post's image committed
  without its bytes in the deployment's storage (in memory and on
  PostgreSQL's layer alike);
- the language: PW5603's form posting anywhere, PW5602's route shared with a
  page, PW5601's limit above what a host reads whole;
- the page: an image's width and height left out of its markup, killed by
  the browser suite (`e2e/uploads.spec.mjs`), whose build `feed.sh` makes
  for that mutant and again once it is restored.

The tests: the server's (`uploads` and `blob`, PostgreSQL's where
`PW_FEED_DATABASE_URL` names a database) and the compiler's
(`compiler/pw-core/tests/uploads.rs`). Run from the repository root; `just
e14-uploads` records the output. The source is restored after every mutant,
whatever happens.
