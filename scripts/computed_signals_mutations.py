"""Mutation controls for ADR-0227: a value computed from a signal is the
browser's, and its first value the host's.

Each mutant undoes one piece: the signal read as one, the component each
computed part names, the path a view's field is read at; the page's module,
each function by its part and given the signal's value decoded, written and
refused; the host's first value, read through a field, the module named and
served only where a plan names it; and the runtime computing each part again,
with the signal's value now, an attribute's included.

The compiler's and the server's tests must fail for a mutant of the compiler
or the server ("cargo"). A mutant of the runtime must fail
`e2e/feed.spec.mjs` in three engines, against a build of the mutated source
("browser"): the store's and the feed's pages, and the server.

Run from the repository root; `just e14-computed-signals` records the
output. The source is restored after every mutant, whatever happens.
