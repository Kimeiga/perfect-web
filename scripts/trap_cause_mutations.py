"""Mutation controls for ADR-0267: a component's trap says why it stopped.

Each mutant undoes one piece: the functions named by their causes, each
tested cause's trap calling its own cause's function, the causes' functions
where a trap looks for them, and the host reading a cause from the frame a
trap stopped in and Wasm's own by its code. The tests of
`compiler/pw-conformance/tests/trap_causes.rs` must then fail.

Run from the repository root; `just e14-trap-causes` records the output.
The source is restored after every mutant, whatever happens.
