"""Mutation controls for ADR-0222: a post is shown before the server
answers.

Each mutant undoes one piece: a target's key left unnamed, in the check and
in the speculation's match; the value a page speculates on, read with what
it shows, carried into the page, sent when it changes and only then, sent
after a longer read, and named by a commit's answer; and the store's cart,
kept apart. The tests of each must then fail.

The browser suite's `e2e/feed.spec.mjs` runs the post in three engines.

Run from the repository root; `just e14-optimistic-posts` records the output.
The source is restored after every mutant, whatever happens.
