"""Mutation controls for ADR-0161: each document is its own subscriber.

Each mutant puts back one piece of the session-wide subscriber:
- in the server: serving a document replaces the session's others, a change
  reaches only the session's latest document, a keyed read goes to the
  latest document, and a session is forgotten with any one of its documents;
- in the browser runtime: the page's long poll, or its stream, names no
  document.

A server mutant must fail the server's tests, all of them run. The
runtime's must fail the two-tab browser test, in Chromium.

Run from the repository root; `just e14-documents` records the output. The
source is restored after every mutant, whatever happens.
