"""Mutation controls for ADR-0058: handlers that compute.

Each mutant undoes one piece of how a handler's body is lowered, how its
captures are read, how its commands are sent and awaited, or what it refuses,
and the handler tests, which run each module under Node, must then fail.

Run from the repository root; `just e10-handlers-compute` records the output.
The source is restored after every mutant, whatever happens.
