"""Mutation controls for ADR-0187: nothing the store contains is on screen
when its page is first laid out.

Each mutant undoes one piece of the host's style for the store:
- the first items of a list contained, or the first lists;
- the lists' threshold dropped, so a menu of many short categories is never
  contained;
- no item contained at all;
- the placeholder back at 42 px;
- the style back in the body.

Every mutant must fail `e2e/stable-layout.spec.mjs`, in some engine, against
a build of the mutated server.

Run from the repository root; `just e14-stable-layout` records the output.
The source is restored after every mutant, whatever happens.
