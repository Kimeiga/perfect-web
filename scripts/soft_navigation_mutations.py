"""Mutation controls for the soft navigation's ADR: a navigation keeps the
layout and shows the next page in it.

Each mutant undoes one piece of the runtime's navigation:
- which navigations are kept: a link's, a handler's after its commit, back
  and forward's;
- what is held to the page: the same build, a layout at all;
- the swap: the page's markup in the slot, the layout's regions taken from
  the next document, focus where the page begins;
- the hand-over: the old runtime ended;
- what a leaving page does: the frames it is told applied to nothing, a
  reader's next choice taken over the one in flight;
- the back-forward cache: a page shown again listening again.

Each must fail `e2e/soft-navigation.spec.mjs` in Chromium. Run from the
repository root; `just e14-soft-navigation` records the output. The source
is restored after every mutant, whatever happens.
