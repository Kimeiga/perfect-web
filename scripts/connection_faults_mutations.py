"""Mutation controls for ADR-0175: charter §15.5's one-shot network error and
forced reconnect, made by the server.

Each mutant undoes one piece:
- the drop: not taken, so every connection is dropped; `before` running the
  command anyway; `after` sending the answer anyway;
- the cut: an open stream, or an open long poll, not ended; a new
  subscription not refused inside the window; a cut that ends what opened
  after it too;
- the controls: `/bench/drop` arms nothing; `/bench/reconnect` cuts nothing.

A drop or cut mutant must fail the development server's tests, all of them
run; a control mutant, `e2e/connections.spec.mjs` in Chromium.

Run from the repository root; `just e14-connection-faults` records the
output. The source is restored after every mutant, whatever happens.
