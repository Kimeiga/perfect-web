"""Mutation controls for ADR-0073: a template reads each value by path.

Each mutant undoes one piece of how a template's values are read: a computed
hole lowered as a blocked part, `pw build` refusing a blocked part, a
directive other than `on:`, and a loop's key read as the path from its
element, by the checker, the template IR and the renderer. The template-value
tests or the renderer's key tests must then fail.

Run from the repository root; `just e10-template-values` records the output.
The source is restored after every mutant, whatever happens.
