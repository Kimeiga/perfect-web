"""Mutation controls for ADR-0219: what a commit drops reaches every
session that reads it, and only those.

Each mutant undoes one piece: the other sessions told, the line between a
session's own entry and a shared one, a whole query's drop, the pages read
again, the committing session left out, and the telling deferred until the
author is answered. The tests of each must then fail.

Run from the repository root; `just e14-cross-session` records the output.
The source is restored after every mutant, whatever happens.
