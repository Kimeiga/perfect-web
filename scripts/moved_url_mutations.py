"""Mutation controls for ADR-0096: a template moves no URL.

Each mutant undoes one piece: refusing a `<base>`, refusing an animation
that sets a link, and one that sets a handler. The tests in
`platform_markup.rs` must then fail.

Run from the repository root; `just e10-moved-urls` records the output. The
source is restored after every mutant, whatever happens.
