"""Mutation controls for ADR-0280: a handler navigates after its command
commits.

Each mutant undoes one piece:
- the compiler's: a navigation naming a page; its arguments related to the
  page's parameters, and the page looked for among the views; written last
  in the `Ok` arm of the command's answer nearest it, an answer bound by a
  `let` among them, and in no handler's body bare; and each value given by
  its parameter's name;
- the runtime's: an answer awaited, not assumed; an `Ok` that did not
  commit refused; a press made while the page leaves not taken; a second
  navigation not taken; the presses made before a navigation answered
  first, each counted while it runs and finished when it ends; a stopped
  navigation, and a page shown again, taking presses again; and an address
  that carries each value as one segment, or refuses it.

The tests of each must then fail: `compiler/pw-core/tests/navigate.rs` for
the compiler's, and `e2e/navigate.spec.mjs` in Chromium for the runtime's.

Run from the repository root; `just e14-navigate` records the output. The
source is restored after every mutant, whatever happens.
