"""Mutation controls for ADR-0186: a page states its description.

Each mutant undoes one piece:
- the rule, PW5034: an item's property (microdata) taken as the page's
  metadata, or let name it too; metadata in a view, inside an element, the
  host's own (a charset, an `http-equiv`, the viewport in any case), one
  that names nothing, one named twice or by a computed value, one with an
  attribute the head does not write, one with no content or a blank one,
  one whose content or a hole of it is computed in place, and a second of a
  name HTML allows once, each let through; a name HTML lets repeat refused;
  names compared by their case;
- the template: metadata lowered with the rest of the view, or numbered
  before the title; the text after its last value dropped; an item's
  property taken into the head, or refused in the body;
- the plan: metadata that reads a signal let through;
- speculation: metadata that reads a speculated value refused as a title
  is;
- the renderer: metadata written into the body, unescaped, or from a value
  that is HTML; the binary's document written without it; a static page
  that states its title shipping the runtime (a correction to ADR-0183);
- the server: the store's page and a signal page written without it, and
  the store's rendered from no values.

A rule, template, plan or speculation mutant must fail `pw-core`'s
`tests/metadata.rs`; a renderer mutant, `pw-render`'s `tests/metadata.rs`
or `tests/titles.rs`; a server mutant, the development server's tests of a
page's head.

Run from the repository root; `just e14-metadata` records the output. The
source is restored after every mutant, whatever happens.
