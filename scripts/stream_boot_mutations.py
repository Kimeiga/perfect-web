"""Mutation controls for ADR-0272: a region the browser fills while the
runtime boots is bound.

Each mutant undoes one piece of the browser runtime: the regions pending
when the page is first indexed not recorded; one that settled while the
runtime booted not read again and bound; and not reported. Each must fail
`e2e/stream.spec.mjs`'s boot test in Chrome, which holds the runtime's boot
at the network until Chrome has filled the region.

Run from the repository root; `just e14-stream-boot` records the output. The
source is restored after every mutant, whatever happens.
