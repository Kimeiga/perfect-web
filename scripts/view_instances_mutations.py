"""Mutation controls for ADR-0203: a view that contains itself is an instance
of its own template, made at run time.

Each mutant undoes one piece:
- the checker: which views contain themselves endlessly, the block on the
  way back that ends one, and that one holds no signal and shows no stream;
- the template: each use an instance, how deep it is used and how deep its
  view nests, and a schema over every view its instances reach;
- the plan: an instance a query gives, rendered again by the host, and one
  the page's signals give, by the browser, given nothing else;
- the renderer: each instance after the markup around it and not on its
  stack, inside its own frame, its own token, the page's values not its own,
  the first error in the document, and the depth a browser nests;
- the views a page sends, and the in-browser renderer reading them;
- the browser: an instance's parts read in its own template, its range, and
  a range paired by its path as well as its id.

A compiler or renderer mutant must fail `views_contain_themselves.rs`, the
renderer's `properties.rs` or the in-browser renderer's tests. A runtime
mutant must fail `e2e/thread.spec.mjs` in Chromium against the staged
build; a server or in-browser renderer mutant the same, after the page and
the server are built again.

Run from the repository root; `just e14-view-instances` records the output.
The source is restored after every mutant, whatever happens.
