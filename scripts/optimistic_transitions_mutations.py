"""Mutation controls for ADR-0122: optimistic transitions, compiled and held.

Each mutant undoes one piece: the backend reading a member function as a
member, the refusal of a speculated read inside a block, the decoder reading
an `Int` into a `BigInt`, the store's transition itself, the server sending
the value a page speculates on, and the version a commit reports. The tests
must then fail.

Run from the repository root; `just e14-optimistic` records the output. The
source is restored after every mutant, whatever happens.
