"""Mutation controls for ADR-0183: a page states its title.

Each mutant undoes one piece:
- the rules: a page served at a route that states no title, a blank title,
  a title in a view, one inside an element, a second one, and one holding
  an element, each let through;
- the template: a title numbered where it is written; the plan not naming
  it; a title that reads a speculated value let through;
- the renderer: a title written into the body; its whitespace kept as
  written; a page's static document titled by its name;
- the server: the store's page titled "Store"; a changed title not set;
- the runtime: the title's part not set as the document's title, or set
  again when it holds its text.

A rule, template or speculation mutant must fail `pw-core`'s
`tests/titles.rs`; a renderer mutant, `pw-render`'s; a server mutant, the
development server's tests; a runtime mutant, `e2e/accessibility.spec.mjs`
in Chromium, against a build of the mutated source.

Run from the repository root; `just e14-titles` records the output. The
source is restored after every mutant, whatever happens.
