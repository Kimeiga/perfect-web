//! The tree-emitting parser: declarations **and** core expression bodies.
//!
//! ADR-0012 sequenced this deliberately — Rowan first, then body parsing — so
//! the body grammar is written once, against the durable representation.
//!
//! Architect ruling on scope: build the **real** expression syntax now, and
//! stage how much *semantic meaning* is implemented over it. Both shortcuts were
//! rejected with reasons worth restating, because they will look tempting again:
//!
//! - an *effect-only* grammar creates a second mini-language. The real parser
//!   eventually sees one program and the effect parser currently sees another;
//!   it can misassociate lambda bodies, call arguments, operator precedence,
//!   nested blocks or match arms while still producing plausible effect results.
//! - *declarations alone* cannot analyse
//!   `List.map(items, item => database.read(item.id))` — the higher-order case
//!   the corpus exists to catch.
//!
//! Trivia is attached before each significant token, so the tree stays lossless
//! by construction rather than by a later repair pass.
