//! The owner's finding of 2026-10-08: signed out, a reader typed into the
//! feed's composer and pressed Post, and the server refused it (`requires
//! SignedIn`, 403) in silence. ADR-0302 tells a refusal where the press was;
//! this holds what a page can tell before the press. A page asks a predicate
//! of its reader by naming it, `{#if SignedIn}`, and the deployment that
//! answers `requires` answers it for the page's principal when the document
//! is rendered: the control and its command ask one policy, as Pundit's
//! views, CASL's `<Can>` and Cedar's UI filtering do, not a second fact of
//! the program's (`me.signed_in`) that can disagree with it.

//! - **PW0629**: a name a template reads is a value. `{#if InteractionId}`
//!   (a type), `{#if P}` (a page) and `{#if SignedIn}` (a predicate) checked
//!   and built until 2026-10-10, and the page failed where it was served,
//!   "no value for `SignedIn`". A predicate with no parameters is what the
//!   page asks of its reader; one with parameters is not asked yet, and a
//!   handler asks none (it runs in the browser, after the document).
//! - **PW5048**: a control whose handler sends a command that `requires` a
//!   predicate with no parameters stands where the page asks that predicate
//!   and it holds: in the first branch of an `{#if}` whose condition has it
//!   as a conjunct, or under `hidden={!P}` (a disjunct), on the control or an
//!   element around it. A view's control is held in the view's own markup.
//!   A control marked `on:press|refusable` is shown to every reader and its
//!   refusal told (ADR-0302): one in a part served to everyone, which no
//!   reader's answer can decide, or for a predicate the page does not ask.
//! - **PW5049**: a page that asks a predicate of its reader is its reader's;
//!   one served to everyone asks none.
