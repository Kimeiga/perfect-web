//! **A predicate a command requires, and the words its refusal is told in**
//! (ADR-0302).
//!
//! `requires SignedIn, OwnsPost(post)` names predicates whose meaning is the
//! deployment's (ADR-0115): the host evaluates each over the caller and the
//! command's typed arguments, before the command runs. Until ADR-0302 nothing
//! said what a reader is told when one refuses, and the browser told
//! nothing: a press that was refused failed silently (the owner's finding of
//! 2026-10-08). Now the deployment that gives a predicate its meaning gives
//! it words too, and a program may declare its own:
//!
//! ```text
//! predicate OwnsPost(post: PostId)
//!     says "Only its author can delete a post."
//! ```
//!
//! PW0351 holds a declared predicate to its words, one string, not empty,
//! with no hole, so it names nothing the refusal read; and a `requires` that
//! names a declared predicate to its parameters, by count and by type. A
//! predicate the program does not declare is the deployment's alone, told in
//! the deployment's words.
