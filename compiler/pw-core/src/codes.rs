//! The one registry of diagnostic codes.
//!
//! Architect ruling, 2026-08-06:
//!
//! > Raw code strings should no longer be declared independently by parser and
//! > semantic passes. Every checker emits the enum, not a raw `"PW5010"`.
//!
//! The `PW0100` collision is why. It was simultaneously the parser's
//! "expected X, found Y" and `rules.rs`'s shared-cache invariant, so a corpus
//! fixture declaring `PW0100` could be satisfied by an unrelated *syntax* error
//! — the harness would go green while the semantic rule it meant to test had
//! never run.
//!
//! # Ranges
//!
//! ```text
//! PW00xx   lexical and syntax
//! PW01xx+  semantic invariants
//! PW50xx   placement, capability and unsafe boundaries
//! PW55xx   the identity track's (ADR-0253): accounts, sign-in, `requires`
//! PW56xx   the uploads track's (ADR-0253): typed uploads and blob storage
//! PW57xx   the notifications track's (ADR-0253): the typed principal, notifications
//! PW58xx   the messages track's (ADR-0253): direct messages
//! PW60xx   the kiokun track's (ADR-0253): kiokun.com in Pleris
//! ```
//!
//! A parallel track registers its codes in its own block, with its own
//! owner, and nothing else may (docs/PARALLEL.md).
//!
//! Ranges are enforced by a test, not by convention.
