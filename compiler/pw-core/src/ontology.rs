//! E8 — what an effect **is**, as a declaration rather than a spelling.
//!
//! Effect ontology slice 2. Slice 1 gave `effect database.read<T> { .. }` a
//! grammar, a `DeclKind` and a namespace. This resolves a written effect
//! against those declarations, and it is the first production consumer of
//! ADR-0022's semantic provenance.
//!
//! Architect ruling, 2026-08-07:
//!
//! > So slice 2 becomes both: completion of the effect ontology; and the first
//! > production implementation of semantic provenance.
//!
//! # The pipeline
//!
//! ```text
//! database.read<Stores>
//!   → EffectPath(["database","read"]) + TypeArg("Stores")
//!   → EffectDefId + TypeDefId
//!   → EffectInstance { effect, args }
//! ```
//!
//! Everything downstream consumes [`EffectInstance`]. **No checker splits
//! `"database.read"` at the dot** — the dot is read exactly twice, both times
//! here: once when a declaration's name is turned into an [`EffectPath`], and
//! once when a written row entry is. After that there is a resolved identity,
//! and an identity does not need re-parsing.
//!
//! # Why a family is derived and never invented
//!
//! `!{ database }` is a legitimate row: charter §7.5A's rule is that declaring
//! a family accepts its members, so a broad claim is broader than any one
//! operation. But `database` is not itself an effect anybody performs.
//!
//! So a family EXISTS because operations were declared into it. There is no
//! `effect database` and no list of valid family spellings in a checker —
//! `databse.read` is unknown because nothing declared anything under `databse`,
//! which is a fact about the program rather than about a table someone
//! maintained. That is the property `docs/RISK_QUEUE.md` 37 cost us when
//! `LayoutAffect` named nothing in five files.
//!
//! # What this module does NOT do
//!
//! It does not decide whether an effect is permitted, where it may run, or what
//! authority it needs. Those are `effects.rs`, `placement.rs` and `contract.rs`,
//! and each of them is a policy over this answer. This module answers only
//! *which declaration did you write*.

    //
    // There was one: a checked set with an empty ontology returned here in
    // silence, on the reasoning that "your effect does not exist" is the wrong
    // thing to say when the truth is "no vocabulary was supplied". The
    // architect ruled against it on 2026-08-07, deciding the same question for
    // placement:
    //
    // > A pure standalone file can still check without a web platform package.
    // > But if it writes `!{ database.read<Stores> }` without a selected or
    // > imported platform environment that declares `database.read`, the
    // > compiler should say, effectively: `database.read` has no meaning in
    // > this program. It should NOT say: I recognize that string from an old
    // > compiler table, so I'll assume origin.
    //
    // What made the exemption look harmless was the table underneath it —
    // placement and capability still had answers for an undeclared effect, so
    // silence here cost nothing visible. With `worlds_for` deleted the silence
    // is the whole failure: the row is unreported, placement is `Blocked`, and
    // a contract comes out with no placements and no explanation.
    //
    // Longer term a project selects `pw-std` and `pw-platform-web` through its
    // configuration and ordinary programs never see this. That is a project
    // environment concern and not a reason for the compiler to answer from a
    // vocabulary the program did not select.
