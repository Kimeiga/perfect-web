//! Charter §7.1, §7.10, §8.2 — three questions about what a value *is*.
//!
//! Not a type checker. A type checker infers a type for every expression; this
//! answers three specific questions the corpus asks, each from a type the
//! author **wrote down**:
//!
//! - **R-008** uses `Option<Store>` where `Store` is expected. Absence is a
//!   value of type `Option<T>` and never an ambient null, so the only way to
//!   reach the `Store` is to match.
//! - **R-009** casts `Unknown` to `Store`. External data enters as `Unknown`
//!   and there is no cast that skips decoding — that is what makes the
//!   boundary trustworthy rather than merely typed.
//! - **R-022** hands a `PressEvent` handler to `on:submit`.
//!
//! Scoping it this way is deliberate. Inferring types for everything would
//! reach these three and a great deal else, and the "else" is where a partial
//! inference engine reports confident nonsense about programs it does not
//! understand. Every rule here fires only where an annotation exists, so a
//! program without annotations gets silence rather than guesses.
//!
//! What that costs is recorded rather than hidden: `store_name` would still be
//! accepted if the author dropped the `: Option<Store>` annotation. The
//! annotation is the specification, and E9 proper is what replaces it.
