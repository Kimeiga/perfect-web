//! E6 — the resource dependency graph (charter §14 M6 task 1).
//!
//! ISR invalidates by route and by timer. This invalidates by **what a thing
//! actually depends on**, which is a different claim and a checkable one: the
//! graph is derived from declarations, so "changing one menu item regenerates
//! store 47's menu fragment and nothing else" is a property of the program
//! rather than a configuration someone remembered to write.
//!
//! # Compile time answers a different question from run time
//!
//! A key is a value, so at compile time there is no node for "store 47". What
//! there is:
//!
//! ```text
//! compile time   MenuFragment(id) --reads--> Menu(id)
//!                MenuChanged(store) --invalidates--> MenuFragment(store)
//!
//! run time       MenuFragment(47) --reads--> Menu(47)
//! ```
//!
//! The compiler produces the **schema** — nodes per declaration, edges labelled
//! with the key expressions that connect them. The materializer instantiates it
//! per key. Saying so matters, because a graph that claimed to know which
//! *instances* exist would be claiming to know the contents of the database.
//!
//! What the schema is nonetheless enough for is the gate: an event carries its
//! parameters, an edge records which of them flows into which key position, and
//! that is what makes `MenuChanged(store_47)` narrower than "the menu changed".
//!
//! # Serializable, because inspectable is a gate item
//!
//! Charter §14 M6 gate item 6 asks for the graph to be inspectable and
//! serializable. Both, and not one dressed as the other: a diagram is not
//! serializable and a blob is not inspectable. `pw emit-graph` prints JSON, and
//! `--plain` prints the edges as text a person reads.
