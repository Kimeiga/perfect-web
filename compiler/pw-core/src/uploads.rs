//! **A file a form posts, and its limits** (track `uploads`, ADR-XXXX; the
//! integrator's ruling of 2026-10-07 on its Q1).
//!
//! ```text
//! upload PostImage
//!     route      "/uploads/post-image"
//!     serves     "/images"
//!     max_bytes  5_000_000
//!     types      png, jpeg, webp, gif
//!     max_width  4096
//!     max_height 4096
//! ```
//!
//! The program states its upload's invariants, as `PostText` states its 280
//! characters, and the host holds a browser to them: `pw build` writes each
//! declaration to `uploads.json`, which the host reads as it reads
//! `sources.json`. Each limit is a literal; `types` is a closed set, each
//! kind one the host sniffs from a file's bytes. A deployment may lower a
//! limit and never raise one.
//!
//! - **PW5601**: each clause written, and each as its domain reads it; a
//!   path a literal path, and at most what a development host reads whole.
//! - **PW5602**: an upload's paths are its own: its `route`, the lease it
//!   shows under it, and what it serves, no page's and no other upload's.
//! - **PW5603**: a form that sends a file posts it, as
//!   `multipart/form-data`, to an upload's route, with one file in it; and
//!   a form posting to an upload's route is such a form. A form is checked
//!   as a link is (PW5009): against what the program declares.
