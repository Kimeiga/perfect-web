//! **The Backend IR — what every backend lowers from, and what none of them
//! may re-derive.**
//!
//! Architect ruling, 2026-08-09, scoping E10-A:
//!
//! > Do not lower directly from HIR into Wasm instructions. […] E10 will later
//! > want multiple backends. The stable division should be:
//! >
//! > ```text
//! > Pleris semantics
//! >       ↓
//! > Backend IR
//! >     /       \
//! >  Wasm       future native backend
//! > ```
//!
//! and the rule that shapes every type in this file:
//!
//! > The backend consumes semantics already established upstream. It must not
//! > rediscover effects, capabilities, placement, privacy, or ABI types.
//!
//! # Nothing here is a name
//!
//! > `DefId`, not names. `DeclaredType`, not reconstructed strings.
//! > `CapabilityId`, not `"database.write"`.
//!
//! This project has spent its life deleting spelling-based resolution —
//! `docs/RISK_QUEUE.md` is mostly instances of it — and a backend that took a
//! string would be reintroducing it at the point where the answer becomes
//! machine code. So [`Type::Nominal`] holds a `DefId`, a call names a `DefId`,
//! and a host call names a [`CapabilityId`] the contract already derived.
//!
//! If a lowering finds itself formatting a name to decide something, that is
//! the bug this module is shaped to prevent.
//!
//! # Three outcomes, never a silent one
//!
//! > Lowering should return `Lowered | Unsupported(reason) | Blocked(upstream
//! > error)`, not turn an unknown HIR node into no instructions.
//!
//! [`Lowering`] is that. A construct the backend does not support yet produces
//! a diagnostic naming it; an upstream error produces `Blocked`, because a
//! program that did not check is not a program with a backend problem. Neither
//! is an empty instruction list, which is what "silently lower differently"
//! looks like from the outside — and which would produce a component that runs
//! and does the wrong thing.
