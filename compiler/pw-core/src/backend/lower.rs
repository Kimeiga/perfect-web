//! **HIR → Backend IR.**
//!
//! E10-A's first stage. Architect ruling, 2026-08-09:
//!
//! > For the first slice, support only the language constructs `add_to_cart`
//! > genuinely needs […] Unsupported constructs should produce an explicit
//! > "backend unsupported" diagnostic, never silently lower differently.
//!
//! and the rule that decides what this file is allowed to compute:
//!
//! > The backend consumes semantics already established upstream. It must not
//! > rediscover effects, capabilities, placement, privacy, or ABI types.
//!
//! # What it consumes rather than derives
//!
//! ```text
//! which calls need authority     the CONTRACT's required_capabilities
//! what a name resolves to        the WORKSPACE
//! what a call returns            SIGNATURES
//! what a type is                 the program's declarations, by DefId
//! ```
//!
//! The one thing it decides is shape: which HIR expression becomes which
//! instruction. Everything a decision depends on arrives already answered, and
//! `no_backend_decision_is_made_from_a_name` is the test that says so.
//!
//! # Why `add_to_cart` gets no special case
//!
//! > Compile exactly one real Pleris command end-to-end first, but do not build
//! > any stage specifically around `add_to_cart`.
//!
//! So the supported set is described as a set of CONSTRUCTS — a call, a name, a
//! literal, a field — and `add_to_cart` is simply a program that stays inside
//! it. `a_declaration_outside_the_supported_set_is_refused_by_name` is what
//! keeps that honest: the refusal names the construct, so widening the backend
//! is a visible act rather than a fixture that started passing.

/// **Proof that the program being lowered resolved and checked.**
///
/// Architect ruling, 2026-08-10, step 10: *enforce resolved/checked program
/// input before E10.*
///
/// The reason is E10-A's founding finding. `examples/store/app.pw` called
/// `current_session()` and imported nothing, every upstream analysis produced
/// an answer for it — no effects, no label, no constraint, no capability — and
/// each of those answers is what a harmless call produces too. The backend was
/// the first consumer for which the absence was fatal, and it found out by
/// failing to emit rather than by being told.
///
/// So the precondition is carried by a **type with a private field**. The only
/// way to obtain a `Checked` is `Checked::of`, which runs the checker on the
/// same units, and `program` takes one. A caller cannot hand the backend an
/// unresolved program by forgetting a step: there is no step to forget.
///
/// It is deliberately not a `bool` on `Context`, and not a documented
/// convention. Both are things a caller can be wrong about, which is the shape
/// of every entry in `docs/RISK_QUEUE.md`.
