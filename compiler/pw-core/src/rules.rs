//! Declaration-level semantic rules.
//!
//! These are the rules decidable from a declaration *header* alone — policy
//! contradictions, placement-versus-effect conflicts, privacy-versus-cache
//! conflicts. They need no expression analysis, so they can run today against
//! the real corpus rather than waiting for body parsing.
//!
//! What this is **not**: the effect checker. A rule like "a network request
//! inside a view" (corpus R-001) lives in a function *body*, which E2 captures
//! as a token range and does not parse. Those stay unenforced, and
//! `docs/milestones/E2.md` says so rather than implying otherwise.
//!
//! Every rule carries a stable `PW####` code, a primary span, and — where the
//! rule involves two places — an origin span, per charter §16.3. The E0
//! diagnostic spike established that shape; this applies it to real files.
//!
//! # E6F: this reads the HIR
//!
//! It used to read `pw_syntax::ast::SourceFile`, a second declaration tree
//! produced by a second parser. Two parsers deciding what a program means is
//! two programs, and E6 showed what that costs: the tree grammar learned to
//! parse a `materialize` block's policies and this path did not, so the same
//! file had policies to one analysis and none to another.
//!
//! Architect ruling, 2026-08-06:
