//! So each invariant gets a directory named for its **symbol**, holding
//! programs the corpus fixture did not anticipate:
//!
//! - `caught.pw` — structurally different from the fixture, same invariant,
//!   must be reported. This is what promotes an invariant to
//!   `GENERALLY_ENFORCED`.
//! - `slips-through.pw` — a program that violates the invariant and is **not**
//!   caught today. It must compile clean, and the moment it stops, the gap has
//!   closed and the file is promoted rather than deleted.
//!
//! The second file is the unusual one and it is the point: a known gap that is
//! only written down drifts out of date silently, and a known gap that is
//! executable cannot. `docs/evidence/P0/readiness.txt` lists these in prose;
//! this is the same list, run.
