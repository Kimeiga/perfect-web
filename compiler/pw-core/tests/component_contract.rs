//! E8-0 — the compiler→host contract, and the one rule that governs it.
//!
//! Architect ruling, 2026-08-07:
//!
//! > Freeze the compiler→host `ComponentContract` […] Rule: actual Wasm
//! > imports ⊆ statically allowed set, never a superset. E8 consumes
//! > capabilities; it does not define effect semantics.
//!
//! and the principle the whole milestone hangs on:
//!
//! > The compiler decides what authority code needs. The host decides whether
//! > that authority physically exists. Neither should reconstruct the other's
//! > answer.
//!
//! # What each test is defending against
//!
//! Every one of these has a plausible implementation that passes a naive test.
//! A contract derived from *declared* placements rather than solved ones looks
//! identical until a declaration is wrong. A capability that drops its type
//! argument looks identical until two arguments exist. An audit that reports
//! "satisfied" for an unparseable import looks identical until one appears.
//! So each test names the thing that would still work.
