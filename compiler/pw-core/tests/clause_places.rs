//! **A dependency-graph clause belongs to a declaration that can mean it**
//! (ADR-0092).
//!
//! ADR-0007 made invalidation explicit: a command emits typed events and
//! invalidates the entries it changes, and a resource or a materialization
//! listens for events and depends on resources. Until 2026-09-26 a clause
//! checked on any declaration. A query that `emits`, a command that listens,
//! a `fn` that emits and a page that invalidates each checked, and nothing
//! read what they said. Each test states one case, with a control.
