//! The compatibility decision, compiled for the browser.
//!
//! One implementation, not two. `runtime/pw-resume` decides; this exposes that
//! decision to a page as `wasm32-unknown-unknown` with a hand-rolled ABI — no
//! `wasm-bindgen`, because the project pins its dependency set and the
//! interface is four integers and two byte buffers.
//!
//! # Why not a JavaScript port
//!
//! A second implementation of a security decision is two things that can
//! disagree, and the disagreement is silent: both sides return a boolean and
//! only one of them is right. The whole reason `decide` returns a typed
//! `Decision` is so the answer carries its reason, and a port would carry a
//! different one.
//!
//! # The ABI
//!
//! ```text
//! alloc(len)            -> ptr        the caller writes the manifest here
//! decide(ptr, len)      -> code       0 resume, 1 migrate, 2.. a refusal
//! last_recovery()       -> code       which recovery the refusal chose
//! last_trace_ptr/len()               the causal trace, UTF-8
//! ```
//!
//! The manifest is the same `|`-separated encoding the fuzzer's harness uses,
//! so a browser input and a fuzz input are the same bytes.
