//! E7V — resume-version compatibility.
//!
//! Charter §8.5. A resume manifest attaches saved state to executable code.
//! `resume.rs` in the compiler already answers two of the three questions that
//! must hold before it may:
//!
//! ```text
//! 1. serializability   can this value be encoded?          compiler
//! 2. authority         may it cross this boundary?         compiler
//! 3. version           can THIS code safely interpret it?  here
//! ```
//!
//! Passing one does not imply passing the others. A `Cart` is perfectly
//! serializable and may not be in a public manifest; a public string is
//! serializable and unrestricted and may still be handed to a handler that no
//! longer means what it meant when the document was rendered.
//!
//! # The invariant
//!
//! > A resume manifest may attach state to executable code only when the
//! > platform has verified that the handler, captured data, document parts,
//! > privacy scope and runtime ABI are mutually compatible.
//!
//! # Why identity is content, not a path
//!
//! `checkout/add_to_cart` is a name. The name survives a rewrite of the
//! function it points at, so a manifest that trusts it will hand last week's
//! captures to code that reads them differently — and the failure is silent,
//! because both sides agree about the name. Identity is therefore derived from
//! the normalized implementation, its resolved references, its capture schema
//! and the platform ABI.
//!
//! **Code identity and capture-schema identity are separate.** Two handlers can
//! compile to identical behaviour while taking different captures, and one
//! handler can keep its capture schema while changing behaviour. Collapsing
//! them makes one of those two cases undetectable.
//!
//! # This version is strict on purpose
//!
//! No structural-similarity inference. Two records that look alike are not
//! evidence that one can be read as the other. Compatibility comes from an
//! exact identity match or from an **explicit, checked migration** tied to both
//! schema hashes. Everything else fails closed with a recovery action.
//!
//! # What this crate is not
//!
//! Behaviour, not a compile-time guarantee — like `pw-tasks` (ADR-0016) and
//! `pw-resource`. A passing test here does not make a mixed-build deployment a
//! compile error. The compiler's half of E7V is artifact agreement **within one
//! build**, which is a different question and lives in `pw-core`.
