//! E7 task 2 — the server renderer.
//!
//! > Given already-checked template IR and values, perfect-web can
//! > deterministically produce correct semantic HTML without Marko.
//!
//! Deliberately narrower than "build the renderer". No resumption, no patches,
//! no document parts, no lazy handlers — those layer on top of a boring,
//! trustworthy HTML serializer, and a serializer that is not boring is not
//! something to layer on.
//!
//! # It does not rediscover meaning
//!
//! The IR arrives with every decision already made: which context a value
//! occupies, which attributes are boolean, which regions are conditional, what
//! a list is keyed by. This crate looks nothing up by name, parses nothing, and
//! guesses nothing. Where the IR does not say, it refuses (see [`Blocked`]).
//!
//! ADR-0018's boundary again: the compiler emits data, the runtime reads it.
//! `pw-core` does not know this crate exists.
//!
//! # Determinism is a property, not an accident
//!
//! Identical IR plus identical values produces identical bytes. Later work
//! depends on it — content hashing, caching, materialization keys, document
//! schemas, resumption identity — so the ordering rules are chosen and written
//! down rather than inherited from a hash map's iteration order.
//!
//! # Nothing invalid disappears
//!
//! A `Blocked` part is an error return, never an empty string. The `Outcome`
//! lesson: a renderer that omits what it did not understand produces a page
//! that looks correct and is missing something, and no test of the page finds
//! it.
