//! E8 — the host decides whether authority physically exists.

//! Architect ruling, 2026-08-07:
//!
//! > The compiler decides what authority code needs. The host decides whether
//! > that authority physically exists. Neither should reconstruct the other's
//! > answer.
//!
//! This crate answers two host-boundary questions:
//!
//! ```text
//! may this component be instantiated on this node?
//!   1. does the node grant every capability the contract requires?   topology
//!   2. is the node's world one the contract allows?                  placement
//!   3. does the artifact import only what the contract allows?       audit
//!
//! may this particular export be invoked for this caller?
//!   4. did the deployment approve every declared precondition?       authorization
//! ```
//!
//! It does not infer effects, solve placements, invent authorization predicates,
//! or decide what a component needs. Those answers arrive from the compiler or
//! the deployment and this boundary refuses execution when one is missing.
//!
//! # Placement is not capability
//!
//! Two checks, not one, because they can disagree in both directions. A node in
//! the right world may lack a capability (an edge node with no cache attached);
//! a node with every capability may be in the wrong world (an origin process
//! asked to run browser-only DOM code). Collapsing them would make one of those
//! two mistakes silently allowed, and which one depends on which way the
//! collapse went.
//!
//! # No ambient authority
//!
//! `docs/evidence/E0/spike-wasmtime-component.txt` measured what this is
//! defending against. A guest built with Rust `std` for `wasm32-wasip2`
//! declares ONE import in its WIT world and the compiled component demands
//! **fifteen** — fourteen `wasi:*` interfaces the world never mentioned,
//! injected by std's runtime initialization. Every one is authority nobody
//! granted, and it arrives without a single line of application code asking
//! for it.
//!
//! That is why the audit is on the ARTIFACT rather than on the source. The
//! compiler can only tell you what the program says it needs.
//!
//! # Handles, not secrets
//!
//! A granted capability yields a [`Handle`] — an opaque reference the host can
//! revoke and account for. The value behind it never enters the guest's memory
//! through this crate.
