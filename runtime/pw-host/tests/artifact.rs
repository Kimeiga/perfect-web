//! The audit, against real components.
//!
//! Architect ruling, 2026-08-07: *"final artifact audit […] adversarial guests
//! attempting undeclared interfaces"*.
//!
//! Everything in `admission.rs` is decided on data, and it must be — a
//! capability decision that needed a Wasm engine to be checked is a decision
//! nobody runs. But the data has to come from somewhere, and the point of an
//! ARTIFACT audit is that the artifact can disagree with the source. So this
//! file reads the imports out of two real components built by
//! `just spike-wasmtime`, and puts them through the same `admit`.
//!
//! # The adversarial guest is not synthetic
//!
//! It is the ordinary one. `spikes/wasmtime-component/guest` declares one
//! import in its WIT world and demands fifteen, because Rust `std` on
//! `wasm32-wasip2` injects fourteen `wasi:*` interfaces during runtime
//! initialization — measured in `docs/evidence/E0/spike-wasmtime-component.txt`
//! and recorded as that spike's finding F-2.
//!
//! Nobody wrote that guest to attack anything. That is what makes it the right
//! adversary: undeclared authority arrives by *default*, from the toolchain,
//! without a line of application code asking for it, and a host that trusted
//! the source would have granted all fourteen.
//!
//! Requires the `engine` feature and the built components:
//!
//! ```text
//! just spike-wasmtime      # builds the guests
//! just e8-host             # runs this
//! ```
