# Known limitations

Reviewed 2026-09-15 against master `4a9bcddc095b3b4d0eac0e0c2ddb8a0143de03d9`
and the evidence-gate repair. Current milestone state is owned by
[STATUS](STATUS.md); implementation order is in [NEXT](NEXT.md).

The former file was primarily an E0 snapshot and still said no compiler or Linux
CI existed. Its complete bytes are retained in
[the historical limitations file](KNOWN_LIMITATIONS-history-2026-09-15.md).
Those historical statements must not override current source or test results.

## Value checking and generated execution

Ordinary call argument types and declared return types are not comprehensively
checked. Arity checking exists; `canonical_abi::a_call_site_is_not_type_checked`
still pins the ordinary-call gap. Signatures now contain resolved identities,
but the inference engine does not yet implement full unification, generic
callable instantiation, or all expression types. Unknown annotations remain
blocked in signatures and at relevant transfer/codegen boundaries; this change
does not add comprehensive source diagnostics for every unknown annotation.

A scope/resource policy is now attached to the resolved type rather than its
spelling, preserving the existing type-level policy. This is not a per-value
ownership proof. Private RPCs now require conditional principal preservation;
that records a runtime obligation, not its execution. Stable nominal capture
identities distinguish modules; complete transitive schema-evolution and host
semantic-ABI validation remain separate work. Foreign code and backend internal
record/variant layouts still need their documented integration proofs.

E10-I has not been established: producing core Wasm and testing host admission
separately does not demonstrate execution of the compiled Pleris command through
the complete component path with the alternative Rust closure removed.

## Research requirements are not implemented guarantees

The census records temporal authority, unknown external outcomes, compatibility
across live versions, composed capacity budgets, optimistic overlap, and unmanaged
browser/foreign behavior. Some related mechanisms already exist, but the census
itself does not prove complete enforcement. Read the per-record status and the
[research/implementation boundary](../research/failures/IMPLEMENTATION.md).

## Evidence and test coverage

The new recipe tests replace producers in isolated temporary trees. They prove
exit-status propagation for the tested recipe shapes, not compiler correctness,
browser behavior, host isolation, performance, or production readiness.

`errexit` and `pipefail` do not make shell execution universally fail-safe.
Independently invoked scripts and shell contexts that intentionally handle errors
need their own tests. Redirected reports may be incomplete after failure; this
repair does not make report publication atomic or validate every printed claim.

No new real-device, screen-reader, cross-browser, database-fault, or production
rollout test was run locally in the September 15 review. Prior observations keep
their original scope. The false-green recipe defect does not prove old tests
failed, but a recipe's zero exit status alone was insufficient evidence.

## Historical measurement interpretation

ADR-0027 supersedes the inference that an undefined frame-level
`forcedStyleAndLayoutDuration` establishes browser non-support. That value is
read from script-attribution records by the repaired instrumentation. Missing
observations and observed zero must remain distinct. Old raw measurements are
preserved, not replaced with invented results.
