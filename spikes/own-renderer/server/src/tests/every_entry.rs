//! **An entry written `_` is every entry at the rest, in every session's

//!
//! A command's `invalidates Timeline(current_session(), _)` hands the host
//! the session alone, and the host drops the session's entries at every
//! limit, and no other session's; `Timeline(_, 20)` drops every session's
//! at 20. And an entry is dropped in every session's partition: a private
//! query's entry is one session's copy. Until ADR-0256 a like dropped the
//! liker's copy of a private thread alone, and another reader's open thread
//! kept its count. Each test states one case, with its control.
