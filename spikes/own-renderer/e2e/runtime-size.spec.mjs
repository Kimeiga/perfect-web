// E7 gate item 7: what a page downloads to run, bounded as it is sent, in
// every run of the suite (ADR-0188).
//
// Until 2026-10-04 these ran only in `just e7-performance`, beside the long
// animation frames that need the machine to themselves, and that had last run
// on 2026-08-07. They bounded the bytes the development server sends,
// uncompressed and comments and all, at 128 KiB. The runtime's script grew
// from 28,471 bytes to 84,822, the page passed the bound between ADR-0152 and
// ADR-0172, and nothing said so. A byte count does not need the machine to
// itself.
//
// Each bound is on a file compressed with Brotli at its highest quality, as a
// static file is sent; the uncompressed and gzip figures are reported beside
// it, and E10 reads the uncompressed one (`just e10-bench`).
