# `dist-kiokun`: its pages, its components and its plans, from
# `examples/kiokun-site`, kiokun's shard rule (`examples/kiokun/Shards.pw`,
# ADR-0041) and the platform's packages. The development server serves it
# with the kiokun layer, chosen by what its contracts import, from
# KIOKUN_DATA or the repository's sample. The browser suite serves it on
# hosts of its own, one per engine (KIOKUN_PORTS).
