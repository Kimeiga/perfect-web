// parts whose values changed**.
//
// # What it never does
//
// No component tree, no replay, no re-render. The document arrived complete
// from the server; this attaches behaviour to elements that already exist and
// replaces the contents of ranges that already exist. Charter §14 M7 gate 4 —
// "no full-tree hydration occurs" — is a property of there being no tree here
// to hydrate.
//
// # Identity comes from the manifest, never from the DOM
//
// A part is found by the id the compiler assigned: `data-pw="7"` for an
// element-anchored part, `<!--pw:s3-->…<!--pw:e3-->` for a range. Nothing is
// located by tag name, class or position, because those change when a designer
// edits the page and an identity that moves is not an identity.

//   `TemplateSchemaId + LocalPartId` identifies a part POSITION. A live
//   document needs `TemplateSchemaId + InstancePath + LocalPartId`.
//
// The distinction is not about loops. A template part DEFINITION is one thing
// and a document part INSTANCE is another, and the same gap appears with a
// component used twice, a conditional region recreated after toggling, and a
// streamed instance. So `InstancePath` is generic: a frame is a repeatable
// scope, and today that scope is a keyed `{#each}`.
//
// ONE traversal builds the index. After that an address is a map lookup, not a
// DOM walk — the comments are the structural truth and this is the cheap view
// of it.
