 * two things that can differ, and the difference would be silent: both return a
 * boolean and only one of them is right.
 *
 * There is no `attach` in this file. The wasm module takes the authorisation
 * inside its own call, so a page has no way to attach a handler except through
 * a decision that returned Resume or Migrate.
