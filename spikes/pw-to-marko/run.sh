# spike: pw-to-marko — charter §14 M3, the Marko rendering adapter.
#
# Generates Marko routes from `.pw` with `pw emit-marko`, builds them with the
# pinned toolchain, and measures the bytes each route ships. ADR-0017 states
# what this is and is not evidence for; the short version is that streaming and
# resumption remain MARKO's behaviours, measured through `pw`.
#
# Nothing under src/routes is authored: it is deleted and regenerated here, and
# it is gitignored so it cannot drift into being the source of truth.
